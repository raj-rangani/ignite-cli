# Main Entry Point

The [dev-cli.sh](mdc:bin/dev-cli.sh) script is the main entry point for the ignite-cli tool. This script:

1. Sources all utility modules
2. Handles command-line arguments
3. Dispatches to the appropriate command implementation
4. Manages error handling and logging
5. Provides step tracking functionality

To run the CLI, use: `./bin/dev-cli.sh [COMMAND] [OPTIONS]` or create a symlink to make it globally available.
